# Nicht Vergessen App
This app has been created for busy people with lot of tasks or for those like me, who like to forgot about what needs to be done.

## Contributing
Any contribution is welcome. Please do PRs only and don't write to master directly.
If you want to write any code, please make a test for your use case first and only then start coding (TDD).
Make sure to run `go vet` and `go fmt` against your code before you commit.
